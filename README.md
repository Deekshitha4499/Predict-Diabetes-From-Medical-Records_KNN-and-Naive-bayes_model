# Predict-Diabetes-From-Medical-Records_KNN-and-Naive-bayes_model
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on patient medical records using two machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes. The implementation involves preprocessing medical data, building models, evaluating their performance, and comparing results.

# Objective
To develop a classification model that predicts whether a patient is diabetic or not based on medical data.
To compare the performance of KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms.
